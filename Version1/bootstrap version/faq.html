	<h3> Frequently Asked Question (F.A.Q.)</h3>
	<br></br>
	<div>
		<h4> What is Coding?</h4>
		<p> Coding is the ability to write down instructions for the computer to perform basic or complex tasks. In this technological age, students can benefit a lot from learning coding early. Technology companies, financial institutions, engineering and research laboratories are all looking for students with good coding skills to solve complex problems and create new products.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4> How will this help my child in School?</h4>
		<p>Coding helps your child in logical thinking and problem solving skills. The ability to break down a big problem into many small tasks  and the ability to formulate a response to solve the problem are easily transferrable to other subjects such as Math and Science.</p>
		<p>This class also hopes to show students what they can achieve with just primary school mathematics and basic coding skills. It can help them understand Math concept better, and inspire them to learn more mathematics and/or coding that will help them in school/university.</p>

		<h4>Why do you teach F# for this class?</h4>
		<p>F# is a Microsoft-developed language based on mathematical principles (functional programming). It allows student to express complicated logic clearly and concisely, and it is very suitable for students with strong mathematics background, e.g. taken a few classes in Math Olympiad.</p>
		<p> According to <a href=" https://www.edge.org/conversation/lera_boroditsky-how-does-our-language-shape-the-way-we-think">
		UCSD Professor Lera Boroditsky</a>: “... people who speak different languages ...... think differently, and (differences in language) can profoundly affect how we see the world.” We believe that this applies to programming languages as well. Students with good mathematics background can achieve much more in coding, and choosing the right language is helpful to their learning experience.</p>
		<p> Furthermore, according to the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology-what-languages-are-associated-with-the-highest-salaries-worldwide">2018 StackOverflow survey</a>, F# is associated with the highest salary worldwide. We believe that teaching F# will be helpful to our student's career prospect.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4>My kid has already learned another language, e.g. Python, Java, etc. Is this class suitable for my kid?</h4>
		<p>Students with basic experience in other programming languages will be able to pick up F# quicker. In particular, basic knowledge of control flow (if-else) and basic arithmatics will be very useful.</p>
		<p>However, be warned that your kid may find mathematical-programming (functional programming) way more difficult than other programming languages (usually based on Object-Oriented-Programming OOP). It may require your kid to <a href="https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-1-1f15e387e536#59c5"> unlearn</a> some of the things that are taught before in order to gain a higher understanding of what they can do with a programming language.</p>
		<p>Mathematical programming is based on completely different principles, which helps to train your kid to think differently and solve mathematical problems that would be difficult using other languaes.</p>

		<h4>Do you offer a course in Python, Java, C++, etc? Do you offer a course in website design/animation/app development/robotics?</h4>
		<p>For parents who prefer their kids to learn another language, or specific aspects of coding, please inform our staff. We will provide the corresponsing courses next semester if enough students are interested in learning such skills.</p>
