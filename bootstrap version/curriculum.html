		<h3>Math-based Coding Lessons</h3>
		<p>S.K.I. Coding School's proprietary coding curriculum are designed around mathematical principles and primary school mathematics. It is designed to showcase the application of primary school mathematics in coding and real life, to solve complex algorithm questions using a step-by-step process.</p>
		<p>Our goals are:
			<ul>
				<li>To draw the connection between our students' primary school education and real-life problems</li>
				<li>To inspire our students, for them to learn more mathematics and computer programming</li>
				<li>To expand their thinking and problem solving skills.</li>
			</ul>

				<p> Our lessons has been tested on university students in National University of Singapore. Here's what they say:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>"Good delivery and very good material." - YiJiong, Year 2 Quantitative Finance Student</li>
					<li>"Even beginners who do not have prior programming experience are taken care of and given the attention." - CheeChau, Year 3 Physics Student</li>
					<li>"Interactive (lessons), allow participants to ask questions freely" - ChangDa, Year 2 Applied Math Student</li>
				</ul>
				<p> We have simplified certain parts of our lessons to make it accessible to primary and secondary school students. It is accessible for students with a good background in mathematics.</p>

		<h4>Who is this course for?</h4>
		<p>This course is designed for students with good mathematical background. In particular, either:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>P5, P6 students who have taken classes in Math Olympiad, OR: </li>
			<li>Secondary school students with good command of mathematics.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A supplement class is available for students who need revisions on the necessary math background.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h4>Expected Results:</h4>
		<p>At the end of the course, students will be able to use computer to solve the following problems:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>What is the sum of all prime numbers between 2 to 10000?</li>
			<li>At a supermarket, given a long list of items, the price for individual items, and the quantity bought for each item, calculate the total bill.</li>
			<li>Starting from the origin, you are given a sequence of commands (e.g. walk North for 100m, walk SouthWest for 200m, etc). Calculate the final location relative to the origin.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This course is NOT about setting up a simple website, or displaying simple animations, or creating a simple app. This course is about solving basic/medium algorithm problems using primary school math and computers.</p>

		<h4>Which math topics does my kid need to know?</h4>
		<p>In order to benefit the most from this course, students are expected to know:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Basic arithmatics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)</li>
			<li>Division and remainder</li>
			<li>Prime numbers</li>
			<li>Exponents/powers </li>
			<li>Basic variable manipulations (x, y)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In particular, your kid should be able to answer these questions without a calculator:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Take any random two numbers between 11 to 99. What is their product? </li>
			<li>Take any random three digit number, divided by a random number between 2 to 10. What is the remainder of the division?</li>
			<li>What are the first 30 prime numbers? Is 119 a prime number?</li>
			<li>For any x, y between 1 to 9, calculate x^y. e.g. 2^5 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32. </li>
			<li>Simplify: 3x + 5y - 7 + 6x â€“ 2y + 3 </li>
		</ol>

		<p>Mr Chang is a financial software engineer working at Numerical Technologies, a risk management software company. He wants to bring his knowledge in the software development industry to primary and secondary school students.</p>

		<p>With experience teaching Calculus in University of Michigan, and teaching math olympiad to primary school students in Singapore, Mr Chang is experienced in breaking down complex mathematical concepts that makes it easy for students to learn.</p>

		<p>He believes that students with good math background should learn computer coding differently from other students. They should use their mathematical talent to learn advanced topics of computer science to achieve greater results</p>		</p>
